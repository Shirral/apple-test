                    <h2>So, you’re the newest picker! Welcome to the fa(r)m. Haha!</h2>
                    <h2>Picking apples! Not much to it - you pick the good ones, you drop the bad ones to the ground. We want no rot, no mould, no holes, no hail marks, no scab, no… you get it, they need to be pretty. If in doubt, ask yourself: would I buy it? …what? No, no, we talk Waitrose quality, not your local farm shop. Think like a normal person, not like these eco hippies who dumpster dive for rotten fruit, then cut off most of it just to save one bite. …okay you know what, just pick the apples that you’d present to the queen. The prettiest and most perfect. Everything else goes to the ground. Okay? And leave no apples hanging on the tree!</h2>
                    <h2>You’re getting paid per bin, but if you pick less than 3,5 bins in a day, we take losses, which we don’t want. Complicated legal stuff, you see. Might need to move you to the packhouse if you’re too slow, you see. So don’t be too slow.</h2>
                    <h2>Arright, that’s enough of a pep talk; now, move your sorry ass to the orchard and get picking - the sun’s almost up!</h2>
